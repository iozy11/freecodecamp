        <p>Welcome to <code>Eclipse Phase</code>, a post-apocalyptic, transumanist horror role playing game. Earth has been ravaged by rogue artificial intelligence under the influence of an alien virus (an event known as <code>the Fall</code>), and humanity has had to escape to the stars to survive. Life off-Earth is not without its own trials, as transhumanity has to grapple with mind-boggling technological advances, aliens, and unknown horrors from between the stars.</p>
        <p> As a <code>transhumanist</code> role-playing game, some tropes that you will encounter include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uploaded consiousness</li>
          <li>Human-level sapient machines and animals</li>
          <li>Reputation-based economic systems</li>
          <li>Nanotechnology</li>
          <li>Terraforming</li>
          <li>Genetic modification</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And other themese that play with what it means to be human.</p>

      <section class='main-section' id='mechanics'>
        <header>Mechanics</header>
        <p>Eclipse phase uses a percentile dice system such as the one found in <code>Call of Cthulhu</code>. To resolve actions, players roll two percentile dice; a roll at or under that player's pertinent skill level is a success, while a roll over the skill level is a failure. Doubles (11, 22, 33 etc) are critical hits, which follow the same rules for being critical <code>hits</code> or <code>misses</code>. </p>
        <p>Damage rolls are tabulated by rolling the requisite number of d10, with modifiers.</p>
      </section>
      <section class='main-section' id='factions'>
        <header>Factions</header>
        <p>There are a few broad divisions of factions in <code>Eclipse Phase</code>. These can be split into:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inner ring and Jovian conservatives</li>
          <li>Outer-ring and outer-Sol far-leftists</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inner ring and Jovian factions resemble what pre-<code>Fall</code> society would have broadly caled conservativism. These systems relly on strictly ordered social hierarchies reinforced by the prevailing economic system, with strong skepticism towards technology they see as contributing the transhumanity's current predicament.</p>
        <p>Outer-ring and outer-Sol societies are often likened to functional anarchies, where power is distributed horizontaly rather than verticaly, with less focus on plenty and more focus on individual freedom. Resources are often less plentiful, and their distribution is relegated to systems of reputation than by classic monetary systems.</p>

      <section class='main-section' id='character_generation'>
        <header>Character Generation</header>
        <p>Character generation is a hot mess with 1000points to spend on aptitudes, skills, and are modified by what type of lifeform you are.</p>
        <p>I suggest doing it twice. You will likely die.</p>
